 ## Fuel Price Analysis in Argentina 


This data analysis project investigates the trends and fluctuations of fuel prices across Argentina over the past few years from 2016 to 2023, focusing on various fuel types and sellers. By collecting and examining data from sources such as government databases and fuel companies, the study aims to uncover patterns of price adjustments, seasonal trends, and regional differences. The dataset, obtained from FP20 Analytics, can be found on [FP20 Analytics Data](https://fp20analytics.com/) website, and contains 30,784 rows and 18 columns.

To reduce redundancy and improve data organization, I applied data normalization techniques. The dataset includes columns such as Year & Month ID, Company ID (Seller), Legal ID, Company Name, Address, City, Province, Region, Product ID, Product Type, Shift ID, Shift Type, Price (Argentine Pesos), Date, Flag Company ID, Flag Company, Latitude, and Longitude.

### Key Findings üìÑ
Following the result of the guide questions from the investigation, these were my key findings :-
- Overall Trend: There has been a continuous upward trend in fuel prices each year from 2016 to 2023.
- Price Variations: Petrol Premium tends to be more expensive than Petrol Unleaded. Compressed Natural Gas and Gasoil prices are lower compared to petrol but still show a significant upward trend.
- Recent Increase: The steep increase in prices from 2022 to 2023 is notable across all fuel types, suggesting possible factors such as economic conditions, inflation, or market changes impacting fuel prices significantly in the most recent year.
#### Monthly Trends: üìàüìà
- **High Prices:** Prices tend to be higher in the middle to later months of the year. For instance, prices peak in October and September for the years provided, often showing the highest values of the year during these months.
- **Lower Prices:** Prices tend to be lower at the beginning of the year, especially in January and February. This pattern is observable across the years, though the gap between the lowest and highest prices has grown over time.
#### Seasonal Patterns:
- **Spring and Summer Peaks:** April to August shows relatively high prices compared to earlier months of the year. Specifically, August and October are consistently among the months with the highest prices in each year.
- **End-of-Year Trends: ** Prices in November and December also show significant values but typically do not surpass the peaks seen in mid-year months like October and September.
